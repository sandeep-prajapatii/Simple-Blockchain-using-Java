# Simple Blockchain using Java

Its an Blockchain prototype made using Java only. It have 2 functions mainly, once the genesis block is made its shows up 

- **TO ADD MORE BLOCK** - This function helps us to add multiple blocks in the blockchain with proper hash connection. Everttime a new blockchain is made its shows the block number of the latest block with its hash and adds the block hash in the block list.
- **VIEW THE WHOLE BLOCKCHAIN** - We can see the whole blockchain and keep the track of it.

**SHA256** algorithm is used to hash the data of the blocks. Its known as Security Hashing Algorithm which is used by many companies to keep the data safe.
Its an ready to use program.
